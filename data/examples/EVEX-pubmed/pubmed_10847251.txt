However, there are physiologic and clinical rationale for renin angiotensin system blockade, with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition as the preferential therapy in these patients.
In this regard, preliminary data with the new class of angiotensin II receptor blockers suggest that these agents may offer benefits equivalent to those observed with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors while offering better tolerance.
