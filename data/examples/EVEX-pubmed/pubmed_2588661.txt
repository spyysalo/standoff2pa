The effect of the antibody against tumor specific antigen was evaluated by comparing the inhibition of DNA synthesis in hepatoma cells with different preparations of methotrexate.
From these results, it is concluded that tumor specific antibody inserted into liposomal membrane would be recognized by surface antigens which were expressed on the plasma surface membrane of rat hepatoma cells and thereby increase the carrying efficiency of drugs to the target cells.
