The Philadelphia (Ph) translocation provides an elegant example of how cytogenetic findings provided the starting point for understanding the genetic mechanisms involved in leukaemogenesis.
Several approaches have been introduced that can specifically detect the Ph translocation or its products; these approaches include fluorescent in situ hybridization, Southern blotting, western blotting and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
Because non-quantitative RT-PCR analysis after therapy gives only limited information, quantitative or semiquantitative RT-PCR assays have been developed that enable the kinetics of residual BCR-ABL transcripts to be monitored over time in patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation, interferon-alpha, or STI571 therapy.
