Liver biopsies from 50 patients with chronic active hepatitis B were analysed immunohistochemically for HBcAg and HBsAg, and with in situ hybridization for HBV DNA.
By double labelling technique, it was disclosed that most hepatocytes with high level of HBV replication did not contain HBcAg or HBsAg.
Conversely and most liver cells strongly positive for HBAg have low or negligible level of viral replication.
