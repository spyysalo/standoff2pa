Transposable dual reporters for studying the structure-function relationships in membrane proteins: permissive sites in R. prowazekii ATP/ADP translocase.
The method is based on in vitro transposition of mini-Tn5 derivatives bearing dual pho-lac reporters [Alexeyev, M. F., and Winkler, H. H. (1999) J. Mol. Biol. 285, 1503-1513].
Two mini-Tn5 transposons, Tnpholac1 and Tnpholac2, were designed in such a way that their insertions can be converted either by restriction-ligation or by in vivo Cre-lox recombination into either sandwich reporter fusions or short amino acid (aa) tags (25 or 42 aa long).
A set of 48 unique insertions in the gene coding for the Rickettsia prowazekii ATP/ADP translocase (Tlc) was generated using Tnpholac2.
Of 13 extramembrane domains in Tlc, only 3 (loops 7, 10, and 13) were found to be permissive, which is in marked contrast to previous observations in the E. coli lactose permease (LacY), where most insertions in extramembrane domains were demonstrated to be permissive.
Interestingly, the 25 aa insertions consistently have 2-fold higher activity than the corresponding 42 aa insertions, which is also in contrast with observations made on LacY.
Finally, in this study we report, for the first time, the frequency of 10 base pair target duplications generated by in vitro Tn5 transposition.
