Proliferation rate and alkaline phosphatase activity were determined, and morphology of the cells was studied with scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
The Ti 4000 surfaces showed after 8 days significantly (P < 0.05) higher alkaline phosphatase activity compared to both other surfaces.
At 15 days of incubation, the alkaline phosphatase activity on Ti 4000 substrates was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than on the other substrates.
