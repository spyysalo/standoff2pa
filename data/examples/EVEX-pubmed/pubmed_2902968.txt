1. Cholera toxin and glucose induce the synthesis of antisecretory factors (ASF) of isoelectric points 5.0 and 4.3, respectively, and of a molecular mass of ca 60,000.
ASF, in nanogram amounts, inhibit intestinal secretion induced by cholera toxin, Campylobacter toxin, E. coli heat-stable toxin, C. difficile toxin A, and Dinophysis toxin.
Intraspinal injection of cholera toxin and glucose induces the synthesis of pituitary ASF much more effectively than does either peroral or intranasal administration.
Cholera toxin and glucose seem to act synergistically while inducing ASF.
Vagotomy abolishes both the intestinal effects of ASF and the peroral, but not the intraspinal induction of pituitary ASF.
ASF has no effect on ion transport across isolated intestinal mucosa from either pig or hen.
The results suggest that both the induction and the intestinal effects of ASF are mediated via the central and intestinal nervous system.
