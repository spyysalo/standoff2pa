After collagenase digestion of the pancreas, islet isolation is traditionally performed under hypothermic conditions in physiological solutions such as Hanks and RPMI.
Loss of amylase (30%) and swelling of the acinar cells were observed in RPMI.
In contrast, no loss of amylase and slight shrinkage of the acinar cells were observed in the UWS.
Islets isolated in UWS demonstrated a superior basal and glucose stimulated insulin release during perifusion.
Electron microscopy demonstrated a well-preserved islet ultrastructure after isolation in both solutions--except for slightly swollen mitochondria after isolation in RPMI.
Autotransplantation of islets in pancreatectomised dogs was successful both after isolation in UWS and RPMI.
