Doppler velocimetry of the umbilical artery as a predictor of pregnancy outcome in pregnancies characterized by elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein and normal amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein.
OBJECTIVE: Women with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) and normal amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein (AFAFP) are at an increased risk of an adverse pregnancy outcome.
STUDY DESIGN: The study group consisted of 85 patients, in whom the only finding was elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein.
