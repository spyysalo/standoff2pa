Clinical significance of serum 7S collagen and type VI collagen levels for the diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis.
OBJECTIVE: To measure serum 7S collagen (7S-C) and type VI collagen (VI-C) levels by radioimmunoassay (RIA) in Chinese patients with various liver disorders and in CCl4-treated SD rats, and to investigate the significance of the elevated levels of serum 7S-C and VI-C.
METHODS: Serum 7S-C and VI-C levels were measured in 40 healthy control subjects, 168 patients with various liver disorders and non-hepatic diseases, and 52 CCl4-treated SD rats by using RIA which was developed in our hospital.
RESULTS: Serum 7S-C and VI-C were significantly elevated in patients with chronic active hepatitis (CAH), liver cirrhosis (LC), hepatic cellular carcinoma (HCC) (P < 0.01 respectively), chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH), and some with non-hepatic diseases (P < 0.05).
Serum 7S-C, serum laminin and hyaluronic acid were well correlated.
Serum 7S-C and VI-C were not closely correlated.
Both collagens were correlated with serum albumin/globulin ratio, aminotransferase and total bilirubin, not with alkaline phosphatase.
In CCl4-treated SD rats, serum 7S collagen and type VI collagen levels were correlated with the degree of hepatic fibrosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum 7S collagen and type VI collagen are useful markers for diagnosing liver fibrosis.
