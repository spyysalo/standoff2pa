Dose-response relationship in the treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura with intravenous immunoglobulin.
The dose-response relationship in the intravenous immunoglobulin treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura was studied in 20 adult patients in a multicenter prospective crossover trial.
The rate of response increases from 3 out of 11 (27%) to 6 out of 10 treatment periods (60%) by raising the 7S-IgG dose given on 5 consecutive days from 164.50 +/- 24.55 to 359.65 +/- 58.62 mg/kg body weight.
A long-term benefit induced by intravenous immunoglobulin treatment could be achieved in 2 out of 14 patients with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.
