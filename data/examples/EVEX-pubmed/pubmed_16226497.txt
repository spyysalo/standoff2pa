The amyloid has a marked affinity for joint tissues, and carpal tunnel syndrome, polyarthralgia, destructive spondyloarthropathy, and bone cysts are the major clinical manifestations of DRA. beta(2)-Microglobulin (beta(2)-m) was identified as the major protein constituent of the amyloid fibrils.
Risk factors for the development of DRA include age, duration of dialysis treatment, use of low-flux dialysis membrane, use of low purity dialysate, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 GG genotype, and apolipoprotein E4 allele, although the retention of beta(2)-m in the plasma appears to be prerequisite.
