Influence of sex steroids on the production of prostaglandins F2 alpha and E2 and response to oxytocin in cultured epithelial and stromal cells of the bovine endometrium.
We used endometrial cell cultures previously characterized in our laboratory to study the effect of estradiol (E) and progesterone (P4) on prostaglandin (PG) production and on regulation of the response of the cells to oxytocin (OT).
Treatment of the cells with E significantly (p < 0.001) increased OT-stimulated PGF2 alpha production in both the epithelial and stromal cells and that of PGE2 in epithelial cells only.
Analysis of the vectorial secretion of PGs in epithelial cells grown on filter inserts revealed that PGF2 alpha is preferentially secreted in the basal (p < 0.001) compared to the apical compartment.
