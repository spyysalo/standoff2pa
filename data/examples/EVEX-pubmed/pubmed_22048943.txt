Prognostic significance of cyclooxygenase-2, epidermal growth factor receptor 1, and microvascular density in gastric cancer.
We sought to study the pattern of expression of two important proteins, cyclooxygenase-2 and epidermal growth factor receptor, and their association with microvascular density, clinicopathological features, and survival in Arab Omani patients with gastric cancer.
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors were studied by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies to cyclooxygenase-2, epidermal growth factor receptor, and CD34.
Positive expression rates of cyclooxygenase-2 and epidermal growth factor receptor were 89.6 and 23.5%, respectively.
Epidermal growth factor receptor over-expression correlated with high microvascular density values, advanced lymph node involvement (N3), and TNM stage presentation (III and IV).
Similarly, lymph node involvement was associated with cyclooxygenase-2 over-expression and high microvascular density.
Univariate analysis showed that epidermal growth factor receptor over-expression, pathological T3 and T4 disease, and overall stage III and IV disease were adverse prognostic factors.
On multivariate analysis using a Cox regression model, expression of epidermal growth factor receptor, and advanced TNM stage were significant adverse prognostic factors for overall survival.
Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor in Arab Omani patients with gastric cancer correlates with aggressive tumor characteristics and is an independent prognostic factor.
Further clinical studies are needed to evaluate the utility of epidermal growth factor receptor immunohistochemistry as a tool for gastric cancer treatment.
