A prophenoloxidase from Artemia sinica: cDNA cloning, expression and activity analysis during early development.
To understand the defense mechanisms of Crustacean animals, brine shrimp Artemia sinica prophenoloxidase (AsproPO) cDNA was cloned and its expression at early developmental stages was examined by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and activity of phenoloxidase (PO) at different developmental stages was further detected by using l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) as a specific substrate in this study.
The deduced amino acid sequence of AsproPO has two putative copper binding sites highly conserved in Arthropods.
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that the gene of AsproPO expressed at Emergence, Instar I and Instar II stages but did not at 0 h and 6 h stages.
Activity measurement showed that PO activity could only be detected at Instar II stage but the other measured stages.
