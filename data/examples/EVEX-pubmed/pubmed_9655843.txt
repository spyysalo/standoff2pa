C-type natriuretic peptide increases myocardial contractility and sinus rate mediated by guanylyl cyclase-linked natriuretic peptide receptors in isolated, blood-perfused dog heart preparations.
Thus we studied the inotropic and chronotropic effects of CNP-22 and BNP-32 compared with those of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)-28 using the isolated, blood-perfused canine right atrial or left ventricular preparations.
A guanylyl cyclase-linked natriuretic peptide receptor antagonist, HS-142-1, inhibited the increases in atrial contractile force and sinus rate in response to CNP, but it did not affect the positive cardiac responses to norepinephrine.
Propranolol did not block the positive cardiac responses to CNP.
These results demonstrate that CNP increases myocardial contractile force with a small increase in sinus rate mediated by guanylyl cyclase-linked natriuretic peptide receptors, probably type B receptors in the dog heart, and suggest that the positive inotropic response to CNP is influenced by the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent signal transduction.
