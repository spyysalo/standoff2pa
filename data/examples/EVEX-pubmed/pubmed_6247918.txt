Complement receptors on normal human lymphocytes containing parallel tubular arrays.
Membrane complement receptors have been identified on a subpopulation of normal lymphocytes containing cytoplasmic inclusions called parallel tubular arrays (PTA) using two different rosetting techniques.
This eliminates binding of marker particles by lymphocytes having Fc receptors.
The presence of PTA lymphocytes at the center of EAC rosettes and FBC rosettes was demonstrated by electron microscopy, indicating that the PTA lymphocyte has a complement receptor.
These phagocytic cells were placed in the lymphocytic series instead of the monocytic series by virtue of complete lack of endogenous peroxidase activity.
