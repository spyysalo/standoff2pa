[Glucose tolerance, insulin and lipids after one week's administration of fenfluramine to overweight patients (author's transl)]
In addition to glucose and insulin, the lipid fractions were also measured.
In the series with pathological glucose tolerance in which the body weight remained unchanged, fenfluramine produced a lowering of the basal levels of blood sugar and insulin.
After oral loading with glucose the total rise in glucose and the rise in insulin in the late phase were diminished.
