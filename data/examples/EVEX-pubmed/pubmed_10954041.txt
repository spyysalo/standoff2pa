Effects of acute alcohol intoxication on pituitary-gonadal axis hormones, pituitary-adrenal axis hormones, beta-endorphin and prolactin in human adolescents of both sexes.
In the present paper we studied the effects of acute alcohol intoxication (AAI) on the pituitary-gonadal (PG) axis hormones, and the possible contribution of pituitary-adrenal (PA) axis hormones, beta-endorphin (BEND), and prolactin (PRL) to the alcohol-induced dysfunction of PG axis hormones.
Our results demonstrated that AAI produces in adolescents a high increase in plasma PRL, ACTH, and cortisol (F), and a contradictory behavior of testosterone (T) according to gender: plasma T was increased in females and decreased in males.
ACTH and PRL correlated positively with F, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEAS) and T in females, which suggests that PRL and ACTH could synergistically stimulate adrenal androgen production.
In contrast, the decrease in T and increase in BEND in males suggests that AAI could have an inhibitory effect on testicular T, perhaps mediated by BEND.
