A RT-PCR polycompetitor for use in quantifying acute phase serum amyloid A, constitutive serum amyloid A, serum amyloid P component, C-reactive protein, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein A2, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and beta-actin mRNAs has been generated and used in quantitative PCR.
The polycompetitor was cloned into the expression vector pSP64(polyA) and a polycompetitor transcript with a poly(A)-tail sequence at the 3'-end was generated by in vitro transcription.
