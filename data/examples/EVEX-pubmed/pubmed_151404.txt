T- and B-cell counts, estimation of Ig receptor fluidity, and expression of virus-coded antigens were correlated with histological findings during the development of virus-induced mouse lymphoma.
Following time sequence of changes was observed in mice with oncogenic MLV- and GLV-A infection but not in GLV-T infection: Significant decrease of Ig receptor fluidity and expression of virus antigen were observed already at the initial investigation, i.e. 2 weeks post virus infection.
