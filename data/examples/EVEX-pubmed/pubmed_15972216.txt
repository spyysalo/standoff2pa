The influence of substrate charge and molecular structure on interphase transfer in cloud point extraction systems.
The specificity of interphase transfer of organic reagents of different types between water and the nonionic-surfactant-rich phases at the cloud point temperature was investigated.
Further evidence of the specificity of interphase transfer in micellar-extraction systems is independent and cooperative influence of substrate molecular structure and hydrophobicity on their distribution.
