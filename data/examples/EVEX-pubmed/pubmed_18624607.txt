Thyrotropin, free thyroid hormones, antibodies to thyroid peroxidase and to thyroglobulin, and actual levels of unconjugated major soy phytoestrogens, daidzein and genistein, were measured in sera collected before, at the end and one week after finishing soy meal consumption.
No significant changes were found in female group, while in males a significant transitory increase of thyrotropin (p<0.0001) was recorded.
When actual levels of phytoestrogens were related to thyroid parameters, the only significant correlations were found between basal levels of daidzein and thyrotropin, daidzein and antithyroglobulin at the end of soy consumption in males, and between daidzein and free thyroxine at the end of the soy ingestion in females.
