Manipulation of growth in pigs through treatment of the neonate with clenbuterol and somatotropin.
Groups of 25 female piglets were given clenbuterol (100 microg/kg BW), porcine somatotropin (pST; 100 microg/kg BW), pST plus clenbuterol, or saline injections from 3 d to 40 d of age.
Clenbuterol caused a marked decrease in beta2-adrenoceptor density in porcine adipose tissue (P < 0.001) and skeletal muscle (P < 0.01).
