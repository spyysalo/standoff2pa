On the other hand, parathyroid overfunction worsened, as reflected by an increase of the serum immunoreactive parathyroid hormone [1-84] level from initially 690 to 1052 pg/ml (normal, 15-60 pg/ml) and an increase of alkaline phosphatase activity, and plasma calcitriol increased from undetectable to a low-normal value.
Predialysis serum total Ca levels decreased rapidly from 2.9 to 2.5 mM but serum P concentrations remained elevated: 1.6-2.5 mM.
Since Al may predispose collagen to develop dystrophic or metastatic calcification, it is suggested that this process is reversible by correcting Al intoxication.
