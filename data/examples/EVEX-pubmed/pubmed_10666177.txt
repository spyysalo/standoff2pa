Relation of glenohumeral and acromioclavicular joint destruction in rheumatoid shoulder. A 15 year follow up study.
METHODS: At the 15 year follow up radiographs of 148 shoulders were evaluated, and the grade of destruction of GH and AC joints were assessed by the Larsen method.
Both GH and AC joints were affected in 62 of 148 (42%) shoulders.
GH joint alone was involved in nine (6%) shoulders and only AC joint was affected in 25 (17%) shoulders.
AC joint destruction correlated with the GH joint destruction, r=0.74 (95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.65 to 0.80 ).
