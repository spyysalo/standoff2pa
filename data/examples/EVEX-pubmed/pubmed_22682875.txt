Blood tests, QOL measures, and levels of plasma CoQ(10) and vitamin E were obtained at baseline and at 8, 16, and 24 weeks.
Baseline CoQ(10) levels in the CoQ(10) and placebo arms were 0.70 and 0.73 mug/mL, respectively; the 24-week CoQ(10) levels were 1.83 and 0.79 mug/mL, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with conventional doses of CoQ(10) led to sustained increases in plasma CoQ(10) levels but did not result in improved self-reported fatigue or QOL after 24 weeks of treatment.
