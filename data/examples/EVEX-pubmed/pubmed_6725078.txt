Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), an endogenous peptide found in mammalian tissues including the lung, is a potent relaxant of smooth muscle.
These results demonstrate that VIP is a potent relaxant of cat tracheobronchial smooth muscle in vitro and that the relaxant effects of this peptide are not mediated through beta-adrenergic receptors or by prostaglandins.
