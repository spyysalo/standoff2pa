METHODS: A 2-year case file of optical coherence tomography (OCT) with the initial diagnosis of idiopathic impending hole (IH) or lamellar hole (LH) was reviewed.
All cases of IH or LH were sequentially examined for more than 9 months.
All cases with IH had vitreo-foveal adhesion, and were separated into type A (foveal detachment +/- inner retinal cysts) and type B (inner retinal cysts only).
RESULTS: Eight cases had type A IH, 15 cases had type B IH, and 27 cases had LH.
Five cases of type B IH were operated.
For the other ten cases, at an average of 11.4 +/- 3.5 months, none had developed foveal detachment or FTMH, but five had developed LH.
CONCLUSION: In idiopathic cases, vitreo-foveal traction with foveal detachment may lead to FHMH, while inner cysts only without foveal detachment seem tend to evolve into LH instead of FHMH.
Furthermore, LH may develop into FTMH.
