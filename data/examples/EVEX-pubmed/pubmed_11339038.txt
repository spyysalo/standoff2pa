[Time course of interferon status of patients with herpetic keratitis during treatment with actipol, a new inteferon inducer]
Interferon (IFN) status was evaluated in 20 patients with various forms of herpetic keratitis over the course of treatment with actipol (0.07% para-aminobenzoic acid).
The following parameters were evaluated: 1) total content of various IFN types in circulating blood and 2) leukocyte capacity to produce IFN in vitro in patient's whole blood cells.
IFN-alpha was induced with Newcastle disease virus and IFN-beta with staphylococcal enterotoxin.
Plasma concentrations of IFN were moderately increased in 45% patients.
All IFN parameters in patients with initially disordered IFN status normalized during actipol therapy and after clinical cure and did not change in the patients with initially normal IFN values.
Hence, local actipol therapy in patients with various forms of ophthalmic herpes modifies IFN status.
