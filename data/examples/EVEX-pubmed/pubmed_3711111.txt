In this report, the secretory response to Ca2+ in GH3 rat pituitary cells permeabilized by electric field discharge has been compared in both magnitude and Ca2+ sensitivity to prolactin (PRL) release from intact GH3 cells.
The half-maximally effective [Ca2+] for stimulating PRL release in permeable cells was approximately 0.5 microM, and maximal stimulation was obtained at 3-10 microM Ca2+.
Moreover, the Ca2+ sensitivity of PRL release in intact GH3 cells (measured by Quin 2 fluorescence) closely resembled the Ca2+ sensitivity determined in permeable cells.
Release of a sulfated proteoglycan whose release is stimulated by secretagogues in intact cells was stimulated by Ca2+ in permeable cells with the same Ca2+ sensitivity as for PRL release.
Maximal Ca2+ stimulation of PRL release in permeable cells required the addition of MgATP.
The above results indicated that PRL release from permeable cells resembles the physiological process in intact cells.
Among calmodulin antagonists tested, only trifluoroperazine inhibited Ca2+-stimulated secretion, whereas pimozide and calmidazolium did not.
