Immunocytochemical localization of the quinolinic acid synthesizing enzyme, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase, in the rat substantia nigra.
Quinolinic acid, an endogenous excitatory amino acid receptor agonist, may play a role in several brain diseases.
In the present study, the immunocytochemical localization of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase (3HAO), the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of quinolinic acid, was examined in the adult rat substantia nigra at the light and electron microscopic levels.
