Detection of HBeAg in the lymphocytes of sero-HBeAg negative patients with chronic hepatitis B and primary hepatocellular carcinoma.
HBeAg has been detected in the peripheral lymphocytes of chronic hepatitis B patients who were seronegative for HBeAg.
The HBeAg was also demonstrated in the lymphocytes of eight voluntary blood donors who were found to be seropositive for HBsAg and HBeAg.
The lymphocyte HBeAg exists in two subentities; a soluble and a particulate form.
