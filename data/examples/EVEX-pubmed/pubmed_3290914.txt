Adult cats were adapted to hypoglucidic semi-purified diets containing casein or soya as the protein source to study the effects of a 2 hr immobilization period.
The control casein group showed higher plasma dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity but lower pyridoxal 5'-phosphate level than control soya group.
Cats fed hypoglucidic casein diet, plasma glucose, insulin and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate levels were increased whereas cats fed hypoglucidic soya diet, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate levels were decreased and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity increased when data were compared to their respective control groups.
A 2 hr immobilization period induced hyperglycemia in all groups whereas cats fed soya diets, plasma insulin level and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activity were significantly increased and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate content significantly decreased.
These results demonstrate that dietary casein and soya protein might be differentiated on a physiological basis and immobilization emphasized the biochemical disturbances observed between the groups thus suggesting a greater resistance to stress in casein groups than in soya groups.
