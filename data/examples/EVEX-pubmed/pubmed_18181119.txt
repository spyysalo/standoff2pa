The need for selective matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibition is of interest because of the range of pathologies mediated by different MMP isoforms.
In the present study, six different hydroxypyrone and hydroxypyridinone ZBGs were appended to a common biphenyl backbone and the inhibition efficiency of each inhibitor was determined in vitro (IC(50) values) against MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -9, -12, and -13.
