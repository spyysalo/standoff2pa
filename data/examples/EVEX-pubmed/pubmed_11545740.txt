Crystal structure of the human nuclear cap binding complex.
The heterodimeric nuclear cap binding complex (CBC) binds to 5'-capped polymerase II transcripts.
The 2A crystal structure of human CBC shows that the large subunit, CBP80, comprises three domains, each containing consecutive helical hairpins and resembling the so-called MIF4G domain found in several other proteins involved in RNA metabolism.
The small subunit, CPB20, has an RNP fold and associates with the second and third domains of CBP80.
Site-directed mutagenesis revealed 4 residues of CBP20 which are critical for cap binding.
