In uremic plasma, it was proven that not only 1-84 PTH but a large C fragment PTH (probably 7-84 PTH) existed considerably and Intact PTH assay measured both PTH molecules.
From our study of the iliac bone biopsy, Whole PTH and Whole PTH/7-84PTH ratio were superior indicator to Intact PTH in diagnosis of adynamic bone disease.
Although there is possibility of induction of adynamic bone disease in vitamin D treatment, Whole PTH will serve as a useful monitoring method in order to prevent such risk.
