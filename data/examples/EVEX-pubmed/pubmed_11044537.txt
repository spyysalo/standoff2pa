METHOD: Anti-Xa activity levels were used to assess prophylactic (33 women) and therapeutic (15 women) dalteparin dosage throughout pregnancy.
RESULTS: In the prophylactic group, anti-Xa activity levels did not vary significantly throughout pregnancy (P=0.15).
The initial dalteparin dose was modified on the first anti-Xa activity measurement in eight women, whose weight was statistically different from those remaining on the initial dose (P<0.001).
The adjusted-weight therapeutic dalteparin dose induced adequate anti-Xa activity levels.
