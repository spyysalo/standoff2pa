One-compartment biofuel cells without separators have been constructed, in which d-fructose dehydrogenase (FDH) from Gluconobacter sp. and laccase from Trametes sp.
The location and the shape of the catalytic waves suggest strongly that the electron is directly transferred to the KB particles from the heme c site in FDH, of which the formal potential has been determined to be 39 mV vs. Ag|AgCl|sat.
KCl.
Electrochemistry of three kinds of multi-copper oxidases has also been investigated and TsLAC has been selected as the best one of the DET-type bioelectrocatalyst for the four-electron reduction of dioxygen in view of the thermodynamics and kinetics at pH 5.
In the DET-type bioelectrocatalysis, the electron from electrodes seems to be transferred to the type I copper site of multi-copper oxidases.
The FDH-adsorbed KB-modified CP electrodes and the TsLAC-adsorbed CG-modified CP electrodes have been combined to construct one-compartment biofuel cells without separators.
